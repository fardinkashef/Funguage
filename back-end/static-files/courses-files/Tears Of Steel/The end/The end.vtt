00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.600
Are you ready?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.600
Of course you're ready, you're a rockstar.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.600
How's it looking, Barley?

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600
We should have about ten minutes...

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.600
Well that's perfect.

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.100
We're on in one! All systems go!
Yeah you, go!

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.600
Go! Move your asses! Go go go!

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.600
I love it! Come on, go!

9
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.600
That's nice.

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.300
Nothing to worry about.

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600
Thom.

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.600
There she is.

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.100
Now.

14
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600
You love her.

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.100
She is your passion!

16
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.600
Be tender to her.

17
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
Be honest! Eh- be tender.

18
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.600
Remind her what love is.

19
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.600
...and, action!

20
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.600
Memory overwrite in progress!

21
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600
You're a jerk, Thom!

22
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.600
Ohp- Sorry! Sorry.

23
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600
Look Celia.

24
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.600
We have to follow our passions.

25
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.600
You have your robotics...

26
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.600
...and I just want to be awesome in space.

27
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600
Okay, they're coming. Two minutes left!

28
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.600
Speed it up, Thom!

29
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.600
Vivacissimo!

30
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.600
Why don't you just admit that you're
freaked out by my robot hand?

31
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.600
Listen Celia, I was young...

32
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.600
...and a dick.

33
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600
But that's no reason to
destroy the world.

34
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600
Why does he do this?

35
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.100
We already tried that one!

36
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.100
Abort!

37
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600
Cut!

38
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600
Whoaaa!

39
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.600
Whoaaa!

40
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.600
Nooooo!

41
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600
You broke my heart.

42
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.600
I know.

43
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.600
You forgot me on earth.

44
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.600
I know.

45
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.600
I should just crush you.

46
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.600
I'm-

47
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.600
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600
Good ad-lib.

49
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.100
Not my fault!

50
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600
This time.

51
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.100
Quiet on set!

52
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600
We're out of time!

53
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.600
Come on!

54
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.600
RAAAAAAAAH!

55
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600
Memory overwrite, 90%.

56
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.600
Captain! We have to abort!

57
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.600
The world's changed, Celia...

58
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.600
...maybe we can too.

59
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600
Memory overwrite complete!

60
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.600
You know.

61
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.600
There's a lesson to be learned from this.

62
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600
Could'a gone worse.
