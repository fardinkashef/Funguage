00:00:04.332 --> 00:00:07.207
It&#39;s incredible. It&#39;s a new species.

2
00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.875
What the bloody hell are those things?

3
00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:12.542
It&#39;s like a gnome shagged a mushroom.

4
00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:27.582
They’re absolutely adorable.

5
00:00:27.582 --> 00:00:30.000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.625
And I bet we’ll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

7
00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:34.957
We&#39;d be famous!

8
00:00:34.957 --> 00:00:36.292
Get on MTV.

9
00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:37.875
I wonder what they taste like.

10
00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:40.500
We really shouldn&#39;t disrupt their habitat.

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.917
Right. Sure, sure.

12
00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:45.500
Greetings.

13
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
Welcome, friends.

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.207
I&#39;ll be right down.

15
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.750
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

16
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.667
What are you guys?

17
00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:02.417
We are Sprites. We sprite balance to the forest.

18
00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:07.667
We take care of the animals, plants, birds, moss...

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.917
Guys? Guys, I...

20
00:01:14.582 --> 00:01:19.542
Hey, uh, little mushroom geezer, you cool with us camping here for the night?

21
00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:24.332
Absolutely. A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.
