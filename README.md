# Funguage

This is Funguage! A web application developed for language learning through video content. Users can click on subtitle words to access definitions, examples, images, and additional information. They can also save words to their personal collection of learned vocabulary and review them later.

## ðŸ”¥ Motivation

Many people struggle to learn a new language using traditional methods like textbooks or flashcards. These methods can be boring, ineffective, and donâ€™t always use real language material. I wanted to create a way to learn a language through engaging video content. Personally, I improved my English significantly by watching the â€˜Friendsâ€™ series, and I wanted to make it easier for others to have a similar experience. I wanted to eliminate the need for learners to write down each new word and look it up later, which can be time-consuming and cumbersome. Instead, I aimed to make this process as simple as clicking on a subtitle word.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start For Developers

First go to your projects folder and clone the repository by running this command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/fardinkashef/Funguage.git
```

I've developed this website using React for front-end and Node.js for back-end, so there are two folders named "front-end" and "back-end" in the root directory of the repository.

### Running back-end app:

So, first change your directory to the back-end folder:

```
cd Funguage/back-end
```

Next install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Now run this command to start the back-end server:

```
npm start
```

### Running front-end app:

Next, change your directory to the front-end folder:

```
cd ../front-end
```

then install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Now run this command to start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Finally open your browser and navigate to this URL to visit the website:

```
http://localhost:5173
```
