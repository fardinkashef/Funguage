# Funguage

This is Funguage! A web application designed for language learning through video content. Users can click on subtitle words to access definitions, examples, images, and additional information. They can also save words to their personal collection of learned vocabulary and review them later.

## Motivation

Many people struggle to learn a new language using traditional methods like textbooks or flashcards. These methods can be boring, ineffective, and don’t always use real language material. I wanted to create a way to learn a language through engaging video content. Personally, I improved my English significantly by watching the ‘Friends’ series, and I wanted to make it easier for others to have a similar experience. I wanted to eliminate the need for learners to write down each new word and look it up later, which can be time-consuming and cumbersome. Instead, I aimed to make this process as simple as clicking on a subtitle word.
